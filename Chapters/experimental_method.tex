\section{Experimental Method}
\subsection{Data format}
For this work a specimen of $\gamme$-InSe was imaged using the momentum resolved electron energy loss technique in an energy filtered transmission electron microscope.
The file was supplied with aligned zero-loss peaks in Gatan's \textit{.dm4} format which had to be converted to a python object for further data processing in python, for the conversion from Gatan's proprietary file to a python object the excellent ncempy package \cite{ncempy} was used.
